    long_description: "One typical notation used for derivatives is Leibniz notation ($e.g.,$ $df/dx$).  Physicists often think of the $df$ and $dx$ as distinct quantities (``differentials'') that can be measured, calculated, and manipulated independent of one another.  In particular, a differential can be thought of as the (small) change in a quantity when a small change is made to a physical system.  A differential can also be thought of as the difference between the values of a quantity between two different (nearby) physical states.  This line of thinking is also valuable for thinking about integration in physical situations."

The activity is an excellent one for fostering representational fluency, as students can be asked to engage with vector field maps on paper, plots in Mathematica, and symbolic expressions for vector fields.

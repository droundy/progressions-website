    long_description: "One typical notation used for derivatives is Leibniz notation ($e.g.,$ $df/dx$).  Physicists often think of the $df$ and $dx$ as distinct quantities (``differentials'') that can be measured, calculated, and manipulated independent of one another.  In particular, a differential can be thought of as the (small) change in a quantity when a small change is made to a physical system.  A differential can also be thought of as the difference between the values of a quantity between two different (nearby) physical states.  This line of thinking is also valuable for thinking about integration in physical situations."

    long_description: "The traditional discussion of divergence in vector calculus derives an algebraic expression in rectangular coordinates. We prefer to give a geometric derivation as flux per unit volume through an appropriately shaped box. In this activity, students learn how to predict the value of the divergence at any point by looking at the vector field near that point.  The activity is an excellent one for fostering representational fluency, as students can be asked to engage with vector field maps on paper, plots in Mathematica, and symbolic expressions for vector fields.  A nice extension is to have students consider vector fields that have different fundamental symmetries and to recognize that they can adjust the shape of the infinitesimal box to take advantage of such symmetry."

    long_description: "The traditional discussion of curl in vector calculus derives an algebraic expression in rectangular coordinates. As with divergence (see the Visualizing Divergence activity), we prefer to give a geometric derivation as circulation per unit area around an appropriately shaped closed curve. In this activity, students learn how to predict the value of the curl at any point by looking at the vector field near that point.  The activity is an excellent one for fostering representational fluency, as students can be asked to engage with vector field maps on paper, plots in Mathematica, and symbolic expressions for vector fields.  A nice extension is to have students consider vector fields that have different fundamental symmetries and to recognize that they can adjust the shape of the infinitesimal box to take advantage of such symmetry."

    long_description: "We would like our students to have both a practical and mathematical understanding of a total differential. In particular, with this activity students learn what the consequences of ``zapping'' a function with the operator ``d'' are. This activity also opens up a conversation on infinitesimals, and their relation to total differentials. The use of variables not associated with the Partial Derivative Machine in this activity allows students to apply the mathematical techniques they have been practicing during the course to a less familiar physical system."

    long_description: This integrated lab activity is designed to ask upper-division undergraduate students to measure the change in potential energy in an elastic system (PDM) between two different states. Students use the Partial Derivative Machine (PDM) to verify experimentally that the forces and dimensions of their system are state variables as well as measure the relationships between these quantities to compute the potential energy of their system. The whole class discussion focuses on the meaning of integration of discrete experimental data.

    long_description: "In this activity, students experimentally determine various derivatives using the partial derivate machine, a mechanical analogue for thermodynamic systems. Students explore the ratio, limit, and function aspects of multi-variable derivatives, with an emphasis on holding different variables constant. This activity is also an excellent exercise in representational fluency, as students must coordinate experiments and tables of data with (new) symbolic notations. $\\textrm{Leibniz Notation}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\rightarrow \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\right)_y$"

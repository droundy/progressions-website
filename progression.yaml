We prefer to give a geometric derivation as flux per unit volume through an appropriately shaped box. In this activity, students learn how to predict the value of the divergence at any point by looking at the vector field near that point.  The activity is an excellent one for fostering representational fluency, as students can be asked to engage with vector field maps on paper, plots in Mathematica, and symbolic expressions for vector fields.  A nice extension is to have students consider vector fields that have different fundamental symmetries and to recognize that they can adjust the shape of the infinitesimal box to take advantage of such symmetry."

    long_description: "The traditional discussion of curl in vector calculus derives an algebraic expression in rectangular coordinates. As with divergence (see the Visualizing Divergence activity), we prefer to give a geometric derivation as circulation per unit area around an appropriately shaped closed curve. In this activity, students learn how to predict the value of the curl at any point by looking at the vector field near that point.  The activity is an excellent one for fostering representational fluency, as students can be asked to engage with vector field maps on paper, plots in Mathematica, and symbolic expressions for vector fields.  A nice extension is to have students consider vector fields that have different fundamental symmetries and to recognize that they can adjust the shape of the infinitesimal box to take advantage of such symmetry."

    long_description: "We would like our students to have both a practical and mathematical understanding of a total differential. In particular, with this activity students learn what the consequences of ``zapping'' a function with the operator ``d'' are. This activity also opens up a conversation on infinitesimals, and their relation to total differentials. The use of variables not associated with the Partial Derivative Machine in this activity allows students to apply the mathematical techniques they have been practicing during the course to a less familiar physical system."

    long_description: This integrated lab activity is designed to ask upper-division undergraduate students to measure the change in potential energy in an elastic system (PDM) between two different states. Students use the Partial Derivative Machine (PDM) to verify experimentally that the forces and dimensions of their system are state variables as well as measure the relationships between these quantities to compute the potential energy of their system. The whole class discussion focuses on the meaning of integration of discrete experimental data.

    long_description: "The First Law\\[\\Delta U=Q+W\\]\\[dU=dQ+dW\\]TheThermodynamic Identity\\[\\]The internal energy is clearly a state function, and thus its differential must be an exact differential \\[𝑑𝑈= ?=đ𝑄−đ𝑊=đ𝑄−𝑝𝑑𝑉\\] only when change is quasistatic. This $−𝑝𝑑𝑉$ term can be a bit confusing at first. You are accustomed to work being $𝐹𝑑𝑥$. With a little thought, you can recognize pp as the force per unit volume, and the ratio of 𝑑𝑉 and 𝑑𝑥 as the area. The minus sign comes from the fact that a positive pressure pushes outwards. What is this $đ𝑄$? As it turns out, we can define a state function 𝑆 called entropy and so long as a process is done reversibly $đ𝑄=𝑇𝑑𝑆$ only when change is quasistaticso we find out that𝑑𝑈=𝑇𝑑𝑆−𝑝𝑑𝑉The fact that the 𝑇 in this equation is actually the physical temperature measured by our thermometers was originally an observation based on experiment. At this point, the entropy 𝑆 is just some weird heat-related state function.If you decide to get a thermodynamics tattoo, my recommendation would be to choose the thermodynamic identity \\[𝑑𝑈=𝑇𝑑𝑆−𝑝𝑑𝑉\\] It is far and away the most fundamental and essential equation, and one which you will need to come back to again and again. It contains hidden within it (if you remember the First Law) the thermodynamic definition of entropy."

    description: "**How contour maps display information**\n\n[![](http://physics.oregonstate.edu/%7Eroundyd/progression/representation-contour-maps-fig-1.svg)]()Figure 1[![](http://physics.oregonstate.edu/%7Eroundyd/progression/representation-contour-maps-fig-2.png)]()Figure 2\n\nA contour graph shows the relationship between three variables using only two dimensions, as shown in Fig. 1. Two variables lie along the horizontal and vertical axes (*x*and *y* in the figure), while the other variable (*V*) is represented using curves along which that variable is constant. It is then possible to read information quickly: \\*e.g.,\\*where the value of *V* is high or low or where it is changing quickly or slowly. The canonical interpretation of a contour graph (as might be taught in multivariable calculus) is that the variable *V* is a function of *x* and *y*. In experimental contexts, however, one might construct a graph like Fig. 2, which shows pressure (*p*) *vs.* volume (*V*) collected at several different values of constant temperature (*T*). Although this can still be interpreted as a contour graph, it can be thought of as one of the axis variables expressed as a function both of the other axis variable and of the variable which is held constant. This usage of a contour graph is not commonly taught in mathematics courses, but may be used heavily by professional scientists.\n\n**Derivatives**\n\nDerivatives can be found from a contour graph in many different ways, which may depend on how the graph is to be interpreted. For example, in graphs like Fig. 1, a derivative of *V* can be found with respect to any variable and in any direction, including *x* and *y*, by choosing two points on adjacent contour lines and dividing the change in *V* by the corresponding change in, for example, *x* or *y*, where the perpendicular direction is typically held constant. The value of such a derivative can also be compared at different points by examining the density of the contour lines. A vector quantity like the gradient can also be found.\n\nDerivatives like the one described above can also be found for the graph in Fig. 2. However, it is also common to find the derivative of *p* with respect to *V*, holding *T* (or another variable) constant. Such a derivative can be found either by choosing points and computing a ratio of small changes or by sketching a line tangent to the constant temperature curve and computing its slope.\n\n**Affordances and limitations**\n\nContour graphs are flexible. The number of contour lines drawn can be changed to alter the resolution. The different curves or the regions between the curves can be given different colors. In cases where there are more than three variables, but only two independent variables, contour graphs for different variables can be overlaid using different colors or line styles, as in Fig. 2.\n\nHowever, contour graphs do not generalize well to functions of three or more variables. They necessarily cannot convey the exact value of *V* at every value of *x* and *y*, information that is carried by a representation like a plastic surface."

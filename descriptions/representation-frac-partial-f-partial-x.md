**Leibnitz notation for a partial derivative.**  This is a familiar
notation, and is the standard notation for partial derivatives in
physics outside of thermal physics.  It is helpful in that it makes
the dimensions of the derivative explicit.

In thermal physics, this representation can be problematic because it
does not make explicit what variables are being held fixed as the
change is made.  In other subdisciplines, such as quantum mechanics or
electromagnetism, the variables being held fixed are generally
obvious.  e.g. we never take the derivative $\left(\frac{\partial
\psi}{\partial x}\right)_r$ where we mix incompatible coordinate
systems.

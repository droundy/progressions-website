The Partial Derivative Machine (PDM) is a mechanical system which can
be used in teaching students multivariable concepts.  The intent is to
provide a tangible system with easily comprehended variables, which
can be used to learn the mathematics of thermodynamics in a familiar
context lacking confusing physical quantities such as entropy and
temperature.

The PDM consists of a system involving a spring (which is often hid
from students beneath a black box), which can be manipulated by two
strings.  This results in four directly measurable quantities: two
positions and two forces.  Only two of these quantities, however, may
be adjusted independently, resulting in a system is mathematically
analogous to an ordinary thermodynamic system with the four quantities
$S$, $T$, $p$, and $V$.

The PDM is conservative system with a potential energy that is changed
by work done through pulling on the two strings, in strict analogy to
the First Law of Thermodynamics.  This enables the use of Maxwell
relations and Legendre transforms.  Thus although the PDM is very
tangible, it does support intangible quantities (potential energy and
work) that closely mirror challenging concepts in Thermodynamics.

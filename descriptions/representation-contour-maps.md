A contour graph shows the relationship between three variables using
only two dimensions, as shown in Fig. 1. Two variables lie along the
horizontal and vertical axes (*x* and *y* in the figure), while the
other variable (*V*) is represented using curves along which that
variable is constant. It is then possible to read information quickly:
*e.g.,* where the value of *V* is high or low or where it is changing
quickly or slowly. The canonical interpretation of a contour graph (as
might be taught in multivariable calculus) is that the variable *V* is a
function of *x* and *y*. In experimental contexts, however, one might
construct a graph like Fig. 2, which shows pressure (*p*) *vs.* volume
(*V*) collected at several different values of constant temperature
(*T*). Although this can still be interpreted as a contour graph, it can
be thought of as one of the axis variables expressed as a function both
of the other axis variable and of the variable which is held constant.
This usage of a contour graph is not commonly taught in mathematics
courses, but may be used heavily by professional scientists.

**Derivatives**

Derivatives can be found from a contour graph in many different ways,
which may depend on how the graph is to be interpreted. For example, in
graphs like Fig. 1, a derivative of *V* can be found with respect to any
variable and in any direction, including *x* and *y*, by choosing two
points on adjacent contour lines and dividing the change in *V* by the
corresponding change in, for example, *x* or *y*, where the
perpendicular direction is typically held constant. The value of such a
derivative can also be compared at different points by examining the
density of the contour lines. A vector quantity like the gradient can
also be found.

Derivatives like the one described above can also be found for the graph
in Fig. 2. However, it is also common to find the derivative of *p* with
respect to *V*, holding *T* (or another variable) constant. Such a
derivative can be found either by choosing points and computing a ratio
of small changes or by sketching a line tangent to the constant
temperature curve and computing its slope.

**Affordances and limitations**

Contour graphs are flexible. The number of contour lines drawn can be
changed to alter the resolution. The different curves or the regions
between the curves can be given different colors. In cases where there
are more than three variables, but only two independent variables,
contour graphs for different variables can be overlaid using different
colors or line styles, as in Fig. 2.

However, contour graphs do not generalize well to functions of three or
more variables. They necessarily cannot convey the exact value of *V* at
every value of *x* and *y*, information that is carried by a
representation like a plastic surface.

"Experiment" is a representation for mathematical quantities that is
seldom taught in a mathematics course.  In Physics, we tend to think
of *mathematics* as a representation of physical (or experimental)
quantities.  Doing so, however, requires that students learn to
connect mathematical expressions, such as derivatives, with the
process by which such a quantity could be measured.

This requires blah blah blah

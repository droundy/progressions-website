"Experiment" is a representation for mathematical quantities that is
seldom taught in a mathematics course.  In Physics, we use
*mathematics* as a representation of physical (or experimental)
quantities.  We can turn this around and understand a physical
quantity or concept as a representation of a given expression, such as
a derivative.

**How an "experiment" displays information**

An experiment itself will often be represented with pictures or a
verbal description, and possibly a symbolic description of how the
data collected must be combined.

For more discussion of this representation, including numerous
examples of thermal derivatives represented as experiments, see our
paper
["Name the Experiment! Interpreting thermodynamic derivatives as thought experiments,"](https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1119/1.4824548)
published in AJP.

**Derivatives**

Using an experimental representation requires students to connect
mathematical expressions, such as derivatives, with the process by
which such a quantity could be measured.  They must explicitly choose
which variable to control, and determine how to measure the change in
the other variable.  Furthermore, they must decide how to hold fixed
the quantity that is held fixed.

**Affordances and limitations**

An experiment is not a particularly general representation for
teaching abstract mathematics, and can only be applied to measurable
quantities.  That said, physics primarily deals with measurable
quantities.  One could argue that the experimental representation is
what makes physics a science.

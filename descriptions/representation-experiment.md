"Experiment" is a representation for mathematical quantities that is
seldom taught in a mathematics course.  In Physics, we use
*mathematics* as a representation of physical (or experimental)
quantities.  We can turn this around and understand a physical
quantity or concept as a representation of a given expression, such as
a derivative.  Using an experimental representation requires students
to connect mathematical expressions, such as derivatives, with the
process by which such a quantity could be measured.

At some level, the experimental representation may seem obvious when
teaching science.  However, students often struggle to apply
operational definitions of physical quantities, and without explicit
practice and teaching will how a given partial derivative might be
measured.  An experiment itself will often be represented with
pictures or a verbal description, and possibly a symbolic description
of how the data collected must be combined.  For more discussion of
this representation, see our paper

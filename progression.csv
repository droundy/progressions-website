Concept,There might be experimental limits on which quantities you can measure,81,[],[],[Experiment],PH 423,,"While it may be possible to conceptualize a particular derivative, such as $\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}\right)_{V},$ Where $U$ is internal energy, $S$ is entropy, and $V$ is volume, that does not mean that the particular derivative can be directly measured. In the above example, the entropy $S$ is not measurable. ",,Active,

In particular, with this activity students learn what the consequences of ``zapping'' a function with the operator ``d'' are.

The use of variables not associated with the Partial Derivative Machine in this activity allows students to apply the mathematical techniques they have been practicing during the course to a less familiar physical system.",inzapd,Active,
Activity,Energy and Integrals,84,"[Differentials are small changes or differences, Individual differentials can be manipulated algebraically]",[Differentials are small chunks],"[PDM, $df$]",PH 423,inpotentiallab.jpg,This integrated lab activity is designed to ask upper-division undergraduate students to measure the change in potential energy in an elastic system (PDM) between two different states. Students use the Partial Derivative Machine (PDM) to verify experimentally that the forces and dimensions of their system are state variables as well as measure the relationships between these quantities to compute the potential energy of their system. The whole class discussion focuses on the meaning of integration of discrete experimental data.,inpotentiallab,Active,
